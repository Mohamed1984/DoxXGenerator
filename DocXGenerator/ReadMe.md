# DocX Generator

DocX Generator generates reports in the form of word files based on template file. The template is a normal word file that is easy to edit and design. The template file is filled with data. The data is assumed to exist in Json data format; thus allowing complex data layout to be mapped to the report.
The template is designed by inserting directives inside label elements.
